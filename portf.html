        <h1>Hello! I'm <span>Quraishi Abdur Rahman,</span></h1>
        <h3>A passionate first-year B.Tech student at IIT Bombay</h3>
        <p> Hailing from the culturally rich city of Aurangabad (also known as city of Gates) in Maharashtra, I bring with me a blend of tradition and modernity in my approach to life and learning.</p>
        <p>From a young age, I've been fascinated by the wonders of technology and its potential to transform lives. This curiosity led me to pursue a path in engineering, where I aim to delve deep into the realms of innovation and problem-solving. At IIT Bombay, I find myself amidst a vibrant community of scholars and thinkers, constantly challenging myself to push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.</p>

            <h2> My Hobbies:  Watching Movies, Playing Volleyball, and Football</h2>
            <p>In my leisure time, I find immense joy and relaxation in indulging in a variety of hobbies that enrich my life and bring a sense of fulfillment. Among these, watching movies holds a special place in my heart. Whether it's immersing myself in the captivating narratives of classic films or exploring the latest releases across genres, I cherish the cinematic experience as a form of escapism and entertainment.Apart from the silver screen, I am also passionate about sports, particularly volleyball and football. There's something inherently exhilarating about the thrill of competition and the camaraderie forged on the court or field. As I spike the volleyball or dribble the football, I feel a sense of exhilaration and unity with my teammates, working together towards a common goal. These sports not only keep me physically active and fit but also teach me valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.</p>
